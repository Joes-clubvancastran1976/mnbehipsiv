Wolf Man... still buzzing in my head like jet engines after a bumpy landing. The theater was a zoo, people shuffling like they're on standby for a flight to nowhere. Popcorn crumbs littering my lap; crunched a piece on accident... but whatever.

I'm all mixed up. That transformation scene — dude turning hairy like my old suitcase rug, but with more growling. It’s that feeling... when you see the clouds peek through just before descent, familiar but strange. Back still aching from those cramped seats. Couldn't focus, jittery.

Holy cow, the fog. Was it on-screen or in my brain? It smeared over everything, like looking through frost-covered windows during a red-eye flight. The sound was wild, yo! The wolf's howl intertwined with my stomach growls (despite the popcorn feast). This mangled mix of terror and beauty. 

> Was that dance in the moonlight? More like turbulence in coach. I think someone asked me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , but I'd rather buckle up and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again in a real theater. Ambient lighting, sticky floors. 

The chase scene flashed by like stewardesses during meal service. It had jaws snapping just like the snapping overhead bins mid-flight. Time slipped, scratched on old vinyl, or maybe it was just the clock I keep in my bag which somehow ticks slower when I'm not 30,000 feet up.

The lead actor's eyes — vacant and searching. Reminds me of passengers trying to find their gate at a crowded airport, and me trying to find my sanity half the time. No clue who I left my thoughts with... somewhere near row 12, seat D.

Gotta admit, I checked my reflection when exiting... paranoid a fur-spouting destiny awaited me. I rolled my eyes, imagining it like our uniforms get less flattering by the year. Must remember to tell her ~ the one who said to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   ~ about my seat neighbor snoring through the best bits, like a gargantuan symphony of mid-century jets.
